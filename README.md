# waveform.gb

An example Game Boy project. The main functionality is in src/main.asm.

This program visualizes the wave form used by the wave channel.  
The wave form can be edited freely and playback of the wave is updated immediately.

To build, install [rgbds][rgbds] and put it in your path.  
Then run `make`. This will create `waveform.gb`.

This project is based off of [bootstrap.gb][bootstrap.gb] by [yenatch][yenatch].
